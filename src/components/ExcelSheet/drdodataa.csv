1,CVE-2020-8913,"A local, arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists in the SplitCompat.install endpoint in Android's Play Core Library versions prior to 1.7.2. A malicious attacker could create an apk which targets a specific application, and if a victim were to install this apk, the attacker could perform a directory traversal, execute code as the targeted application and access the targeted application's data on the Android device. We recommend all users update Play Core to version 1.7.2 or later.",20200212,https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8913,High 8.8,"CWE-22, CWE-281","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
